# YourLocalChatBot
---
Your local chatbot is an easy to use, modifiable, and beginner friendly Chat Bot. YLCB is developed by [Teddy](https://twitch.tv/depressionscr).

### Why should I use YLCB?
Because it is easy to use, frequently updated, we pay attention to user requests, and it is highly modifiable due to the use of discord.py's cog system

### What is the Cog System?
It is an easy way to load, reload, and unload files from use with the Discord API. 

### Why do you use a database?
We don't store personal data on our databases, only information you give us or information used internally within the bot itself (ex: your point balance or discord id)

### This is it?
No! We host and maintain all our plugins you can find them [here](https://github.com/teddybear315/YLCB-Extensions)
